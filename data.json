Information about the availability of high-speed Internet services, commonly called Broadband, was collected from broadband provider companies regarding the technology type and speed of services offered. The data was updated every six months for five years, and is shown on the NYS Broadband Map at www.broadbandmap.ny.gov as well as the National Broadband Map at www.broadbandmap.gov. The data on the map depicts broadband availability at the Census Block level. This table summarizes the information for each municipality (town, city, village, Indian Reservation) in New York State.",

This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.",

Initially, twenty-three programs received grant funds for this purpose. Currently, 186 victim/witness assistance programs have grant awards from the OVS, ranging from $32,000 to over $1.8 million. OVS supports statewide, comprehensive victim/witness assistance services in all sectors of the community. Criminal justice agencies, non-profit victim programs and specific municipal programs all receive support. Examples include DA offices, Probation Departments, YWCAs, local police departments, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations. \r\n\r\nThis data set contains all service locations associated with OVS VOCA awards. It should be noted that some programs do not have a physical address listed, instead, they show a PO Box. In these cases the physical addresses are safeguarded as they are generally Domestic Violence shelters providing services to victims who may be in danger were their location to be disclosed.",

We try to address all energy efficiency improvements in a single, comprehensive effort.  This data set contains information on energy efficiency projects completed since 1987. The data set is updated in a quarterly basis to reflect new data as projects are implemented. The information includes project location, customer name, project name, total cost, and energy efficiency benefits, including energy reduction (electric, natural gas, oil) and greenhouse gas emissions reductions.",

In addition, the Department administers any taxes imposed on consumer utilities services and other special taxes on selected commodities and services by municipalities and city school districts. This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state’s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions’ fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections. The sales tax distribution information in this data set can be found in this publication.",

Under the approved U.S. Department of Energy plan, customers purchasing appliances qualified for a rebate of $75 ($105 with documented recycling) for ENERGY STAR qualified refrigerators, $75 ($100 with documented recycling) for clothes washers and $50 ($75 with documented recycling) for freezers. $500 rebate ($555 with documented recycling) were also available for high-efficiency dishwashers, clothes washers and refrigerators that meet CEE super efficiency levels when they were purchased as part of a three-appliance package. The plan was approved by the DOE on December 1, 2009. The program was launched February 12, 2010 and closed March 4, 2011 after processing over $16.58 million in rebates",

Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists.

The MPA must encompass at a minimum the Census Urbanized Area and the contiguous geographic area likely to become urbanized within the next 20 years.

Over the years, we've consolidated or eliminated departments, cut personnel, refinanced debt, reduced departmental expenditures, extended the life of our landfill, successfully lobbied for increase State aid and identified new sources of revenue.  These actions are the blocks upon which this budget is built, as they continue to have a recurring benefit to our bottom line.  It is important to note that, in fact, 84% of this budget, exclusive of debt services, is related to personnel costs.  The remainder is related to essential operating services, such as utility expenses; building maintenance; insurance costs and the like.",

Data in this dataset are from Table 3, 5 and 7 of the report. It includes the distribution of credit and average amount of credit by credit type and place of residence. A large proportion of EITC claims are paid out in the form of cash rebates to taxpayers. This is because credit claimants are typically low and moderate-income taxpayers who have little or no pre-credit tax liability. However, in a significant number of cases credit claims are used to offset pre-credit New York State tax liability. In the aggregate, approximately 85 percent of credit claimed is typically returned to taxpayers in the form of cash rebates.
